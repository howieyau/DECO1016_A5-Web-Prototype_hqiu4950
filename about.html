                        <p>Since 1947, Flight Safety Foundation has helped protect everyone who benefits from air travel, everywhere in the world. The Foundation is an international non-profit organization exclusively chartered to provide impartial, independent,
                            expert safety guidance and resources for the aviation and aerospace industry.</p>

                        <p>The Foundation is in a unique position to identify global safety issues, set priorities and serve as a catalyst to address these concerns through data collection and information sharing, education, advocacy and communications.
                            The Foundation’s effectiveness in bridging proprietary, cultural and political differences in the common cause of safety has earned worldwide respect. The common good of safer air travel continues to inspire individuals and
                            organizations to rise above competitive interests towards shared objectives.</p>

                        <p>Today, membership includes more than 1,000 organizations and individuals in 150 countries. The Foundation is based in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., has a regional office in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

                        <h4>70 YEARS OF MAKING AVIATION SAFER</h4>
                        <p>Since Flight Safety Foundation was organized in 1947 by Jerome F. “Jerry” Lederer, it has initiated projects and developed products to reduce risk and improve aviation safety worldwide.</p>

                        <p>The Foundation has received several awards in recognition of its work. These include the Air Transport World magazine Joseph S. Murphy Industry Service Award in 2008, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Excellence in Aviation
                            Research Award in 2004, the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Pinnacle Award for safety education in 2000 and the Flight International Aerospace Industry Award for training and safety in 1998, 2000 and 2002.</p>

                        <h4>RECOGNIZING CONTRIBUTIONS TO AVIATION SAFETY</h4>
                        <p> Every day, tens of thousands of people around the world contribute to making commercial aviation the safest form of transportation. They do so not because they expect special recognition. They think safety and act in ways that
                            promote safety because they know the aviation industry depends on it, and because it is the right thing to do.</p>

                        <p>Flight Safety Foundation cannot salute all these men and women individually, although it pays tribute to them in the aggregate. But each year, it singles out individuals, organizations and teams that have made especially outstanding
                            contributions to risk reduction, often during long periods or entire careers. AWARD PROGRAMS</p>
